  <h2><b> PPN-ARE: Representation-Enhanced Cascading Multi-Level Interest Learning for Multi-Behavior Recommendation </b></h2>
</div>
# Introduction
üèÜ **PPN-RAE**, as a parallel positive-negative interest extraction method that leverages cascading multi-behavioral views to learn the multi-level interests of users, is proposed to **achieve consistent SOTA performance in the corresponding multi-behavioral recommendation tasks**.
üåü**Observation 1: Neglected Massive Multi-level Negative Feedback** 
As shown in Figure (a) below, under the cascade structure, each auxiliary behavior in the Tmall and Bebe datasets corresponds to a positive feedback signal feature. In addition, we quantify the feedback signal characteristics of each cascade, as shown in Figs. (b)(c) below, on average, negative feedback accounts for nearly 40% of the total amount of feedback signals in each cascade and far exceeds the number of target interactions.

üåü**Observation 2: Problem Passing in Cascade Structures** 
The learning effect of upstream behaviors greatly influences the learning of preferences for downstream target behaviors and ultimately shapes the overall recommendation effect, while the importance of target behaviors is not fully appreciated in the cascade structure.

# Overall Architecture
The architecture of the proposed PPN-ARE, mainly consists of four modules: (I) Positive Residual Block Sequence, (II) Negative Residual Block Sequence, (III)Embeddings parallel cascade, and (IV) Target behavior prediction and recommendation. Positive View Chain Generator and Negative View Chain Generator generate feature views for (I) Positive Residual Block Sequence, and (II) Negative Residual Block Sequence respectively.
